This issue of Rad HAZU is dedicated to professor Marko Tadi&#263;, a full
member of Croatian Academy of Sciences. Professor Tadi&#263; was born on November
16, 1953 in Kolo (near the town of Tomislavgrad, Bosnia and Herzegovina).
He graduated mathematics at the University of Zagreb in 1976, and
finished his Ph.D. thesis in 1980 at the University of Zagreb under supervision
of professor Dragan Mili&#269;i&#263;. He has been professor at the Department of
Mathematics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Zagreb for all of his career.
Professor Tadi&#263; has been visiting and lecturing at many universities and institutes
including the very prestigious University of Chicago, Universit&eacute; Paris
7, Max-Planck-Institute f&uuml;r Mathematik (Bonn), University of Utah, Sonderforschungsbereich
170, Geometrie und Analysis (G&ouml;ttingen), Mathematisches
Institut Der Universit&auml;t MÃ¼nster, The Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology, Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Singapore), Hebrew University
(Jerusalem), Mathematical Institute in Oberwolfach, Weizmann Institute
of Science (Rehovot), Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger International Institute for Mathematical
Physics (Vienna) etc.

Professor Tadi&#263; is world renowned leading expert in representation theory
of reductive <i>p</i>-adic groups and Langlands programme. The paper of
Hanzer and Grbac <em>The Tadi&#263; philosophy: an overview of the guiding principles
and underlying ideas in the work of Marko Tadi&#263;</em> in this issue describes
his works in detail. We mention here two key results. Firstly, one of his early
fundamental contributions is the classification of unitary irreducible complex
representations of the <i>p</i>-adic general linear group <i>GL</i>(<i>n</i>). That was published
in 1986. The result at that time was really surprising and deep (methods even
apply to real and complex <i>GL</i>(<i>n</i>)). It has been in use ever since with major
applications in various problems in the Langlands programme, such as, for
example, the very recent deep works of Arthur. Secondly, since the nineties
of the last century, the main line of research in the Langlands programme
has been concentrated on classical groups. Because of that, professor Tadi&#263; 
had turned his attention to the problems of the classification of irreducible
representations of classical <i>p</i>-adic groups. The problems in this case are much
more difficult than for <i>GL</i>(<i>n</i>), and developing his method of Jacquet modules
he was able to achieve a lot. We would like to mention here that he was
able to achieve, jointly with C. M&#339;glin, very elegant, complete and explicit
construction of discrete series for classical groups which are cornerstones of
the classification of all irreducible representations.

The impact of professor Tadi&#263; in developing a world class research in
mathematics in Croatia is invaluable. He was encouraging and supporting development
of research in representation theory, automorphic forms and number
theory. The articles in the present issue reflect this.

For his outstanding accomplishments, professor Tadi&#263; has received many
awards and recognitions including <em>Prize "Ru&#273;er Bo&#353;kovi&#263;"</em> 1989 (the highest
annual prize for natural sciences in Croatia), medal <em>Red Danice Hrvatske
s likom Ru&#273;era Bo&#353;kovi&#263;a</em> 1996, <em>Andrija Mohorovi&#269;i&#263; prize</em> of University of
Zagreb (2013). He was elected to a full member of the Croatian Academy of
Sciences and Arts and the Academia Europea in 2000.
